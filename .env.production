# Use a CDN or direct hosting service for production models
# Models must be uploaded to this service separately
VITE_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://liamfenn.github.io/icu-models
# Alternative options:
# - Upload models to Vercel directly, then use: VITE_MODEL_BASE_URL=""
# - Set up a proper CDN like Cloudinary
